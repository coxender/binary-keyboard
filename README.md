# Binary Keyboard

A webpage for typing in solely ones and zeroes.

This webpage is for the user who wants a special keyboard. A very dichomous keyboard. A keyboard in which any number of keys pressed mean the same thing.

## Have you ever wanted to:

- slam your hands on the keyboard to make intelligible output?
- type solely in 8 bit utf-8 characters?
- be superior in every conceivable way to your non-encoding knowing friends?

This is for you.

Enjoy.
